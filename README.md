# Digital-Upskilling-BioScience: A Jupyter Notebook Resource for the Biosciences

Welcome to **Digital-Upskilling-BioScience**, a comprehensive, scaffolded curriculum of interactive Python-based Jupyter notebooks designed to teach coding, data analysis, and omics exploration to undergraduate and graduate life science students. This resource was built and tested in large-enrollment biochemistry courses and is grounded in pedagogical research published in our 2024 paper:

> *"Data science for Biochemists: Integrating and evaluating the use of interactive digital Python notebooks in a large enrollment undergraduate biochemistry course"*

## 📃 Repository Overview

This repository contains four levels of instructional content, each level introducing progressively more advanced biological data science applications.

### ▶ Levels Overview

* **Level 0 – Foundations**: Introduction to Python and core data types using Pandas and plotting. Includes 4 beginner-friendly notebooks on:

  * Data manipulation with Pandas
  * Intro to visualizing protein structures
  * Working with basic metabolomics datasets
  * Fundamentals of transcriptomics and proteomics

* **Level 1 – Applied Omics**: Intermediate projects that explore:

  * Structural bioinformatics using Py3Dmol and PDB data
  * Pathway visualization with Escher and Flux Balance Analysis
  * Working with real-world transcriptomics and proteomics data
  * Basic integrative omics and analysis pipelines

* **Level 2 – Advanced Data Integration**:

  * Integrating metabolic networks and time-course data
  * Cross-modal comparisons between RNA/protein abundance
  * Custom visualizations and intermediate coding logic

* **Level 3 – Data Science Meets Biology**:

  * Variant effect prediction with large-scale mutation data
  * Analysis using AlphaFold models and PTM datasets
  * Single-cell imaging and epigenomics datasets (e.g. ATAC)
  * Multi-omics integration and biological interpretation

## 🔎 What You Will Learn

Across all levels, students will:

* Gain confidence in Jupyter Notebooks and Python
* Analyze real biological data from metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and structural biology
* Explore cancer genomics, variant effect interpretation, and 3D protein structure-function mapping
* Learn transferable data science skills in a biological context

## 🏛️ Classroom-Ready

These notebooks were used with >400 students per semester at UNC Chapel Hill in a biochemistry course (CHEM430), with assessments showing significant improvements in:

* Attitudes toward coding and omics
* Comfort with data analysis tools
* Research engagement

All materials are designed for scalability, accessibility, and compatibility with platforms like **CyVerse** (no installation needed).
